👋🏽 Hello! I am a curious, resourceful, and empathetic technologist with a passion for creating innovative solutions that enhance our daily lives. 

I started in operations and product, wearing multiple hats in startups and purpose-driven orgs. Curiosity led me to explore different roles within product, building a strong foundation in problem-solving and cross-functional collaboration. A proud moment was leading a learning platform launch, boosting engagement by 15% through data-driven improvements.

Working closely with engineers sparked my pivot into mobile development to round out my skill set. Now, I build Android apps with Jetpack Compose, Hilt, and Retrofit, focusing on practical problem-solving, great user experiences, and strong architecture, testing, and performance. 

My biggest learning? Every skill compounds. Understanding product, business, and engineering gives me a unique edge as a developer who sees the bigger picture.
 
👥 I am committed to supporting organizations that value equity and inclusivity. My other areas of interest and focus include UX/UI design, Digital Accessibility, and AI/Machine Learning for good.
